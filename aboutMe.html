      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Hiya and I come from India.
        I am in Year 12, studying at the International School of Lusaka. I decided to face the issue of sexual harassment and abuse during the camp of SOWCoders.
        This is a social issue that, despite numerous campaigns and awareness programs,
        still happens to several women and girls, not just in my community but all around the world.
        Women being considered unimportant is something that needs to change and they need to be able to feel comfortable with doing what they want.
        This app aims at gethering all women from different part of India to participate in activities they like and are interested interested in. I personally think, every women should
        know to protect themselves and stand up against all odds.
